TimeGuard Access Shield: Password-Controlled Time-Restricted 
Machine Operation System 

TimeGuard Access Shield is a secure, password-based access and machine control 
system that limits equipment operation to defined working hours. The project ensures that only 
authorized users can operate a device and only within the valid time schedule, improving 
safety, preventing unauthorized usage, and enabling reliable automation in industrial or 
controlled environments.
